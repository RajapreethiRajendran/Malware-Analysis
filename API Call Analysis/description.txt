###Need:
In today's technologically advanced environment, malware analysis is a crucial component of cybersecurity. Malware analysis is essential for identifying, assessing, and reducing cyber risks as they develop and grow more sophisticated.
An effective technique for spotting suspicious patterns or indicators of malicious behavior in an application is API call sequence analysis.
